1. Create a function in front-end that will output the same value as the user input from the size and toppings dropdown forms.
  Input: Small, Olives
  Output: Small, Olives
2. The program will create a unique pizza using a constructor that takes the arguments of pizzaSize, topping, and a base price of $10.
  Input:  inputSize and inputTopping = Small and Olives
  Output: userPizza
3. The program will apply the all pizzas created from the user to a prototype that takes an array of sizes and toppings to calculate the price of the pizza.
  Input: userPizza = Small and Olives
  Output: Small Olive Pizza is $12
4. The program will use front end logic to display the output of the prototype to the user.
